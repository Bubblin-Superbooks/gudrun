These Hartmut heard, and asking their cause, was told his father had been slain. Then looking about him and seeing how they were beset on all sides, he said to his followers: “Honor enough have we won to-day. Let us withdraw into the castle and await a more favorable opportunity for a fresh attack.”</p></div> </div>
